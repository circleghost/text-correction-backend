## Description

Comprehensive testing suite for the authentication and usage tracking features, followed by production deployment setup. This task ensures all components work correctly together and the system is ready for production use.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Testing Coverage
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ code coverage for auth and usage tracking modules
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all backend services and middleware
- [ ] Create integration tests for complete auth flows
- [ ] Build end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Add performance tests for API endpoints under load

### Security Testing
- [ ] Validate JWT token security and expiration handling
- [ ] Test rate limiting and usage quota enforcement
- [ ] Verify API key security and access controls
- [ ] Conduct security audit for authentication flows
- [ ] Test protection against common attacks (CSRF, XSS, injection)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test user registration and login flows end-to-end
- [ ] Verify usage tracking accuracy across all endpoints
- [ ] Test dashboard data accuracy and real-time updates
- [ ] Validate quota enforcement and user notifications
- [ ] Test API integration between frontend and backend

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Set up production environment configurations
- [ ] Configure production database and migrations
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging for production
- [ ] Implement production security configurations
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling and load balancing

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Load test authentication endpoints (100+ concurrent users)
- [ ] Performance test usage tracking under high load
- [ ] Validate dashboard response times with large datasets
- [ ] Test API response times under stress conditions
- [ ] Memory and CPU usage optimization verification

## Technical Requirements

### Test Infrastructure
- Jest/Vitest for unit testing
- Supertest for API integration testing
- Cypress/Playwright for E2E testing
- Artillery or K6 for load testing
- Coverage reporting with Istanbul

### Production Setup
- Docker containerization for deployment
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Production-grade database setup
- SSL/TLS certificate configuration
- Monitoring with health checks

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing in CI pipeline
- Deployment automation scripts
- Database migration automation
- Environment promotion process
- Rollback procedures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test all authentication service methods
- Test usage tracking calculation logic
- Test dashboard data transformation
- Test API middleware and validators
- Test error handling scenarios

### Integration Testing
- Full user registration and login flows
- Usage tracking data flow from API to dashboard
- Rate limiting and quota enforcement
- Database operations and transactions
- Third-party service integrations

### E2E Testing
- Complete user journey from signup to usage
- Dashboard functionality with real data
- Error scenarios and edge cases
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness

### Security Testing
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Token manipulation and replay attacks
- SQL injection and XSS prevention
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Data privacy and GDPR compliance

## Performance Targets

- Authentication API: <200ms response time
- Usage tracking: <100ms per request
- Dashboard load: <3s initial load
- 99.9% uptime target
- Support 1000+ concurrent users

## Dependencies

- **Task 004**: Admin Panel - requires admin functionality to be complete
- **Task 005**: Usage Dashboard - requires dashboard to be functional
- Production infrastructure access
- Monitoring and logging tools
- Performance testing tools

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tests pass with 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Security audit completed with no critical issues
- [ ] Performance tests meet target metrics
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured
- [ ] Documentation updated for production setup
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Team trained on production monitoring
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Production health checks passing

## Notes

- Coordinate with DevOps team for production setup
- Ensure database backup and recovery procedures
- Plan for gradual rollout with feature flags
- Prepare incident response procedures
- Consider staging environment for final validation

## Risk Mitigation

- Have rollback plan ready for deployment issues
- Test all failure scenarios in staging
- Prepare hotfix process for critical issues
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Plan for database migration rollback if needed
