## Description

Build a comprehensive usage dashboard UI for users to visualize their text correction usage, track quotas, and monitor API consumption patterns. This task focuses on client-side visualization without email notification features.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Dashboard Components
- [ ] Create responsive usage dashboard page with modern UI design
- [ ] Implement real-time usage statistics display (requests/corrections per day, week, month)
- [ ] Build quota progress bars showing current usage vs limits
- [ ] Display usage history with interactive time-range selectors
- [ ] Show API endpoint usage breakdown (different correction types)

### Data Visualization
- [ ] Implement usage charts using Chart.js or similar library
- [ ] Create daily/weekly/monthly usage trend graphs
- [ ] Build usage by correction type breakdown (grammar, spelling, tone, etc.)
- [ ] Add usage comparison features (current vs previous period)
- [ ] Display usage patterns and peak usage times

### User Experience
- [ ] Implement loading states for all dashboard components
- [ ] Add error handling for failed data fetching
- [ ] Build responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [ ] Create export functionality for usage data (CSV/PDF)
- [ ] Add in-app notifications for quota warnings (90%, 100% usage)

### Performance & Integration
- [ ] Optimize dashboard performance with data caching
- [ ] Implement real-time usage updates via WebSocket or polling
- [ ] Integrate with usage tracking backend API (Task 003)
- [ ] Add usage data filtering and search capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components
- React dashboard components with TypeScript
- Usage statistics cards and widgets
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Responsive grid layout system
- Modal dialogs for detailed usage views

### API Integration
- Connect to usage tracking endpoints
- Real-time data synchronization
- Proper error handling and retry logic
- Data transformation and formatting

### State Management
- Manage dashboard state with Context/Redux
- Cache usage data for performance
- Handle real-time updates efficiently
- Persist user dashboard preferences

## Files to Modify/Create

### New Files
- `src/components/Dashboard/UsageDashboard.tsx`
- `src/components/Dashboard/UsageCharts.tsx`
- `src/components/Dashboard/QuotaProgress.tsx`
- `src/components/Dashboard/UsageHistory.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useUsageData.ts`
- `src/utils/chartHelpers.ts`
- `src/types/usage.types.ts`

### Modified Files
- `src/App.tsx` (add dashboard route)
- `src/components/Navigation/Sidebar.tsx` (add dashboard link)
- Update routing configuration

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all dashboard components
- Integration tests for API data fetching
- Visual testing for charts and graphs
- Responsive design testing
- Performance testing for large datasets

## Dependencies

- **Task 003**: Usage Tracking Backend - requires usage data API endpoints
- Chart.js or similar visualization library
- Date manipulation library (date-fns or moment.js)
- Export functionality libraries

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Usage dashboard displays real-time usage statistics
- [ ] Interactive charts show usage trends and patterns
- [ ] Quota progress indicators work correctly
- [ ] Dashboard is responsive across all device sizes
- [ ] In-app quota notifications function properly
- [ ] Export functionality generates accurate usage reports
- [ ] All components have comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (<3s initial load)

## Notes

- Focus on user-friendly visualization of complex usage data
- Ensure dashboard performance with large datasets
- Implement progressive loading for better UX
- Consider accessibility requirements for charts and graphs
- No email notifications required (covered in separate task)
