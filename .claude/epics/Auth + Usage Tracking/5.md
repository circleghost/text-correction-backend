# Task 004: API Integration

## Overview
Integrate authentication middleware and usage tracking into all existing API endpoints, ensuring every request is properly authenticated, tracked, and quota-enforced. This task modifies the current text correction API to work seamlessly with the new authentication and usage tracking systems.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Middleware Stack Integration
```javascript
// Express middleware order
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
app.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }));
app.use(rateLimiter);
app.use('/api', authMiddleware);
app.use('/api', usageTrackingMiddleware);
app.use('/api', quotaEnforcementMiddleware);
```

### Updated API Endpoints
- [ ] Modify existing endpoints to support authentication:
  ```
  POST   /api/correct-text        - Text correction with auth & tracking
  POST   /api/suggestions         - Suggestions with auth & tracking
  GET    /api/user/usage          - User usage statistics
  GET    /api/user/quota          - User quota information
  ```

- [ ] Add new authenticated endpoints:
  ```
  GET    /api/history             - User correction history
  POST   /api/feedback            - User feedback submission
  GET    /api/stats               - User statistics dashboard
  DELETE /api/history/:id         - Delete history item
  ```

### Request/Response Flow
1. **Authentication Check**: Validate JWT token and extract user
2. **Rate Limiting**: Check if user exceeds rate limits
3. **Quota Validation**: Verify user has sufficient quota
4. **Request Processing**: Execute original API logic
5. **Usage Tracking**: Log usage data and consumption
6. **Quota Update**: Deduct used quota from user limits
7. **Response Enhancement**: Add usage info to response

### Database Integration
- [ ] Update existing API queries to include user context
- [ ] Add usage tracking inserts to all endpoints
- [ ] Implement quota consumption updates
- [ ] Add proper database transaction handling
- [ ] Optimize queries for performance with auth data

### Error Handling Updates
```javascript
// Enhanced error responses
{
  "error": "quota_exceeded",
  "message": "Monthly character limit exceeded",
  "details": {
    "quota_limit": 10000,
    "quota_used": 10000,
    "quota_remaining": 0,
    "reset_date": "2025-10-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## API Documentation Updates

### Authentication Headers
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Updated Request/Response Examples

#### Text Correction Endpoint
```javascript
// Request
POST /api/correct-text
{
  "text": "This is a sample text with some errors.",
  "options": {
    "language": "en",
    "level": "advanced"
  }
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "corrected_text": "This is a sample text with some errors.",
  "corrections": [...],
  "usage": {
    "characters_used": 45,
    "quota_remaining": 9955,
    "requests_today": 15
  },
  "performance": {
    "processing_time_ms": 1250
  }
}
```
